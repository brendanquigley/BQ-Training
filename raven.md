Edgar Allen Poe


drop this change!

rapping style!
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary.
Over many a quaint an curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly came a tapping
Like someone breaking it down, spitting out lyrics, straight up rapping
tis some homie, I muttered, before breaking out my guns

Ah distinctly I rememeber blasting so hard
Laughing so I think my mind is gone


Tell me why o why are we blind to see//This is a terrible poem
