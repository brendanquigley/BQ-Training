Edgar Allen Poe


Rapping style!
Once upon a mindnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary.
Over many a quaint an curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded nearly napping suddenly came a tapping
Like someone breaking it down, spitting out lyrics, straight up rapping
tis some homie, I muttered, before breaking out my guns
